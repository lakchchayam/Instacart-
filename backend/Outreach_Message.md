**Subject:** Connection from Western: Applying your CASCON research to Instacart analytics

Dear [Muhammad/Dr. Chowdhury],

I hope you’re doing well. 

I’m writing to you as your former Master’s student from Western (2022-2024). I’ve been following your recent work at Instacart and was particularly impressed by your paper on **Transformer-Augmented TCNs for Retail Sales Data** at CASCON 2025.

Since graduating, I’ve been working as a Machine Learning Specialist at **Lushio**, where I’ve focused heavily on marketplace logistics and demand forecasting. Your research inspired me to build a **Partner Analytics Dashboard** using the Instacart Open Dataset, where I implemented a Transformer-based forecasting engine to model weekly sales dependencies.

Specifically, I’ve applied the concept of **"User Share vs Request Share"** (Lushio logic) to the Instacart dataset to show how retail partners can better understand their marketplace dynamics.

Given my background in BI Security (which you supervised) and my recent professional experience in marketplace engineering, I would love the opportunity to join your team at Instacart. Would you be open to a brief chat or a referral?

Regardless, thank you for the foundation you provided during my thesis—it has been invaluable in my career as an engineer.

Best regards,

**Lakchchayam Divya Khare**

## 💡 Why this works:
1.  **Academic Respect:** Acknowledges his research, proving you are still an active learner.
2.  **Professional Growth:** Shows you moved from "student" to "engineer" at Lushio.
3.  **Direct Value:** You are already building exactly what his team at Instacart builds (Partner Analytics).
4.  **Implicit Referral:** It's hard for a supervisor to say no to a student who is now successfully applying their research.
